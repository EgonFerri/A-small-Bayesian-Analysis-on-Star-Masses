# A-small-Bayesian-Analysis-on-Star-Masses


This little_tiny_exercise inspired by a not so old paper, is just one example of what can be done. We all know what a star is, and we all know that they form and evolve in decently well-understood way. The Hertzsprungâ€“ Russell diagram where we graph each star in terms of its brightness against its temperature (color), was one of the tools that led astronomers to speculate about stellar evolution: stars, while fusing hydrogen in their cores, collapse from red giants to dwarf, and then, in the course of their lifetimes, move down along the so called main sequence, a prominent diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right of the H-R diagram.

Now, the problem we are tackling here is an old one, strictly related to these issues: determining the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The IMF plays an extremely crucial role in shaping stellar population: it determines the probability distribution of the mass at which a star enters the main sequence; it regulates the relative abundance of massive versus low-mass stars for each stellar generation; it influences most observable properties of stellar population and galaxies, and it is also required as input in some models of galaxy evolution.

For an astrophysicist the ultimate goal would clearly be to infer the IMF from first principles, but here we content ourselves with an empirical, data driven alternative: fit the IMF using a lognormal distribution as suggested by Zaninetti but in a Bayesian framework using OpenBUGS/JAGS.
